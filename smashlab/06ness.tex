As you might know, Ness is an annoying boy. When he wants to do something, he just doesn't stop.

Today, Ness wants to make a new \LaTeX~macro \verb|\pklist| that makes it easy for him to make a list of moves he'll perform on the battlefield like: Thunder \textrightarrow~Fire \textrightarrow~Fire \textrightarrow~Flash.

However, just like his repertoire of attacks, Ness wants the \verb|\pklist| command to be as flexible as possible. Specifically, he wants that the command should be able to take in an arbitrary number of arguments and insert arrows between them.

\verb|\pklist{1}| : 1

\verb|\pklist{1}{2}| : 1 \textrightarrow~2

\verb|\pklist{1}{2}{3}| : 1 \textrightarrow~2 \textrightarrow~ 3

\verb|\pklist{1}{2}{3}{4}| : 1 \textrightarrow~2 \textrightarrow~3 \textrightarrow~4

Hopefully you get the point! Unfortunately, \LaTeX~doesn't support these kinds of demands natively so Ness has come up with a hacky workaround. But something is wrong!

\newcommand{\pklist}[1]{
    #1 \@ifnextchar\bgroup{\recursepklist}{\par}
}
\newcommand{\recursepklist}[1]{\textrightarrow~#1 \@ifnextchar\bgroup{\recursepklist}{\par}}

Can you debug Ness's command so that the hardcoded render and the function call render look the same?

\underline{Hardcoded}

Fire \textrightarrow~Thunder \textrightarrow~Flash \textrightarrow~Magnet \textrightarrow~Final Smash.

\underline{Function Call}

\pklist{Fire}{Thunder}{Flash}{Magnet}{Final Smash}

% HINT: The \@ifnextchar conditional is not working as expected right now.
