# Summerlab

Welcome to Summerlab!

Before you start, make sure to pull this week's lab.

This week's lab is a lot like summer vacation: relaxing and much too short.
All you have to do is write 2-3 sentences in plans.txt explaining what you
would like to do next summer, and any steps you have taken or plan to take to
make that happen.

To check your work, you can run this command:

    $ driver/driver

(All this does is make sure that you've written something in plans.txt)

As usual, before submitting your work you need to add and commit your changes.

To submit your work to Autolab, use `make`, and scp the handin.zip file to your
laptop to upload it to Autolab:

    # From Andrew:
    $ make

    # From your laptop
    $ scp ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu:~/path/to/your/handin.zip .
